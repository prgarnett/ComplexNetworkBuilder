# Complex Networks Builder - Philip Garnett

This is the software that produces various networks from the [Systems-Mapping-Sheets](https://github.com/prgarnett/Systems-Mapping-Sheets) structured spreadsheets. The software was developed and refined over a number of projects ([Algorithmic Indexing](https://algorithmicindexing.net), [MapUKHE](https://mapukhe.net/), [ActEarly](https://actearly.org.uk/)) to support gathering network/graph data of relationships for systems mapping or complex network analysis.  is in alpha, and should be used with care and some functions are hard coded in so are probably not generalisable very easily. It will be updated in the near future to make the basic functionality more adaptable and a more detailed readme provided.
