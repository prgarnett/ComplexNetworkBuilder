# Complex Networks Builder - Philip Garnett

This is the software that produces various networks from the [Systems-Mapping-Sheets](https://github.com/prgarnett/Systems-Mapping-Sheets) structured spreadsheets. The software is in alpha, and should be used with care and some functions are hard coded in so are probably not generalisable very easily. It will be updated in the near future to make the basic functionality more adaptable and a more detailed readme provided.
